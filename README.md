### cg-fragshaders 

Fun with Fragment Shaders!

This application makes use of HTML's WebGL2 API to implement rendering techniques with GLSL for the shader. Implemented 5 required filters and one custom filter which identifies specific colors, in this case the pink cherry blossom leaves, changes those colors to match the blue water. Could have gotten more creative / precise with parameterization but coverting color accurate values takes a while for little upside potential.
